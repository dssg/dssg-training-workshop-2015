API is "Application Programming Interface".  It's a fancy-pants CS
phrase for "The language I use to talk to some other entity in the
computational universe."

Like most languages, any particular API has
   * Nouns: the (abstract) physical things you can manipulate
   * Verbs: the actions possible on the nouns

Unlike most languages that you probably know, (but like Python and
SQL), APIs are "formal" languages rather than "natural" languages.
Formal languages (usually) do not tolerate ambiguity, which you are
probably discovering is both good and bad.

--------------------------------
You've already seen "screen scraping"---reading rendered (visible) web
sites computationally, and extracting information from them. But,
that's a really inefficient mechanism.  It is like having someone send
you a letter by dictating it over the phone to a typist, and having
them type it out.  In fact, it's even worse, because a lot of
information gets thrown away---e.g. all the text formatting of the
original document (italics, boldface, pictures, etc.) is lost in the
dictation.

An API instead allows you to get at the underlying data from which the
web site (or other service) is rendered.  But, in exchange for this
expressive power, we have to deal with a little bit more complication.

--------------------------------
Twitter does not allow anonymous uses of its API; you must be
authenticated.  Authentication is the fancy-pants CS term for the
question: 

   "Who are you?"

For twitter apps, there are two forms of this question:

   "What application is making this request?"
   "On which user's behalf are these requests made?"

The "user" part is optional, but we'll use it anyway.  

Authentication relies on something you know (e.g. a password),
something you have (e.g. an M-Token), or something you are
(e.g. biometrics.)  Twitter relies on something you know to represent
both of those things: two long sequences of random characters.

One pair is the "Consumer key and secret".  The "key" identifies your
app, the "secret" is the thing your application knows.  You get this
pair when you register your app with Twitter.  I've created a sample
app already for us to share, and will leave it up for a few weeks
after the boot camp ends.  After that you can create your own and just
substitute the key/secret pair.  The web site to do this is:

    dev.twitter.com/apps

You need to be signed in to twitter to access this page.  Each
application is "owned" by some Twitter user, but can be "used" by any
Twitter user.  

That's where the second pair of "secrets" comes in.  They are the
"Access token and secret" The "token" identifies the user running the
app, and the secret is the thing that only that user knows.  Because
this is per-user, each user will have a different token/secret pair.  

One way to get them this is through something called the "OAuth
Dance".  We just have a piece of code that does this for us, included
in your resources bundle, called:

    oauthDance.py

It exports a single function called "login()" that you can just call
directly.

The very first time you do this, you will go through a few steps to
authenticate the app to your personal twitter account---you must be
logged into Twitter under your account with your default browser
first!  The app sends a message to twitter asking to be connected to
your account.  You authorize the app, and get back a PIN code to enter
so that the app knows "it's you."  Once you do that, the app remembers
your per-user access token and secret (stored in a file called
out/twitter.oauth) and will re-use them again.  You can look at
oauth_dance.py to see how this works, but you really don't need to.

All of our Twitter scripts will start the same way: we will obtain a
"twitter object" by logging in to twittter.  

**** loggingIn.py
---------------------------------------
import twitter
import oauthDance

t = oauthDance.login()

print "Success!"
---------------------------------------

The object "t" provides the methods that do the work of querying
twitter for us.

There are four main "nouns" in the Twitter API.  The first two are
probably pretty obvious:

   * User       someone who uses twitter
   * Tweet      the utterances that twitter users produce
 
There are two more that might not be so obvious, but are important

   * Entities   the "special" parts of a tweet.  These include
                #hashtags, @mentions, URLs, and uploaded media
                (pictures, video, etc.)
   * Places	a flexible way of naming phyisical spaces in the
                world.


Each of these "nouns" is really a *composite*---they consist of a
bunch of other parts, which may also have parts, and so on.  For
example, a tweet might contian:

    * Created_At      When the tweet was issued
    * Entities        A list of hashtags, mentions, etc. in this tweet
    * Favorite_count  The number of times the tweet has been
                      "favorited"
    * Retweeded       Whether it has been retweeted by the current
                      user

These contained parts are sometimes called "fields".

Almost all fields can be empty; fields that can legally be empty are
called "nullable fields", and if they are empty, they exist, but have
the value "NULL".  NULL is the special value in CS that means "no
value at all."  It's the value that has no value!

Some fields change based on who is doing the asking.  For example,
suppose that Jerry tweeted "ICOS is great!" and you retweeted it, but
I didn't.  When you look at that tweet you see that it's "retweeted"
value is "true".  When I look, I see that it is "false".  Such fields
are called "Perspectival"---they depend on *perspective*.

(Note: it turns out to be a little complicated to decide who is doing
the "asking", but we'll get to that later.)

See this for a full-blown example of what this can look like:

https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects/users

-----------------------

The "verbs" that we'll be using to begin with are part of something
called the "REST API".  API, we already know.  REST is an
'alomst-acronym' that stands for:

   "REpresentational State Transfer"

The idea behind a RESTful systems is that you have 

    * a "service" that:
	* holds "state"---"state" is another word for
	  information or, collquially, "stuff"; and 
	* has one or more "clients" that interact with it.

    * A client makes a "request" that: 
        * (optionally) "transforms" state in some way, 
        * induces a "response" that is sent back to the client 


These requests are the "verbs". 

When you log in to twitter, your web browser is the client; it
requests the last so many tweets on your home timeline and displays
them.  This is a request that does not transform Twitter's state.

But, when you post a tweet, that's just another request that *does*
transform Twitter's state; namely, it adds a new tweet to its
database.

Every client request receives a response; at a minimum, the response
is "the request was successful."

Not every request modifies state.  For the most part, our applications
will not modify state; we are only extracing information from twitter,
we are not tweeting, etc.

------------------------

We'll start by getting just one single tweet from one specific user.
The user in question is:

     https://twitter.com/UMBigData

Open that page in a tab.  There are also two developer pages that
describe what we need.  Open these two pages in their own tabs:

    https://dev.twitter.com/docs/platform-objects   (the nouns)

    https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1   (the verbs)

The verb we will use to get the tweet is "statuses/user_timeline".
Click on that.  Notice that it takes potentially many arguments: we
will use two: screen_name (the name of the account we are reading
from) and count (the number of tweets we want).

The file oneTweet.py shows how this works.  We convert the "Verb" in
the field guide to method notation; each slash is a new sub-method.
So, "statuses/user_timeline" becomes:

   t.statuses.user_timeline(...)

And, the verb "foo/bar/baz" would be expressed as:

   t.foo.bar.baz(...)

To pass the arguments, we provide the names of arguments, and their
values.  So, since we want one tweet from the screen name "UMBigData",
we say:

   t.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name="UMBigData", count=1)

Note that the order of the arguments does not matter.  this is just as
good:

   t.statuses.user_timeline(count=1, screen_name="UMBigData")

Even though we ask for only one tweet, it's returned as an array, so
we want "tweets[0]"   We can print it:

    print tweets[0]

but the contents of a tweet are kind of ugly; they are encoded as JSON
objects, a particular format for data exchange.  You can use the
json.dumps line for a prettier version that spells out each of the
fields more clearly:

   print json.dumps(tweets[0],indent=4)

If you want to access only some fields of the tweet, you can do so by
name.  For example, we'll print just the text of the most recent
UMBigData tweet:

   print tweets[0]['text']

Warning 1: the text is printed in a particular encoding which some
terminals may or may not know how to handle.  If you are having
trouble seeing the text of some tweets, let us know and we can help.

Of course, we can ask for more than one, and we do that by increasing
the "count" value:

    t.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name="UMBigData", count=2)

To work with each of the tweets returned, we use a loop across the
returned array:

def printTexts(tweets) :
    for tweet in tweets :
        print tweet['text']

The version of this is in 

    twoTweets.py

------------------------

Twitter only allows us to get at most 200 tweets at once.  If a user
has more, we need some way of doing so.  twoTweets shows that even if
you ask twice, you get the most recent tweets both times.

Instead, we will use the tweet identifiers to limit the tweets we are
asking for.  Each tweet is assigned a numerical identifier, and they
are guaranteed to be unique and get larger over time.  So, if one
tweet has a larger ID than another, it is more recent.

We can use this for most of the "fetch timeline" operations; by
specifying a maximum ID, you will only get tweets older than that one.

The file fourTweets.py shows how this works.  All the work is done in
printTexts().  It is handed an array of tweets, and iterates through
them, printing the contents.  As it does so, it *also* keeps track of
the *lowest* tweet ID it has seen, and returns that when it is done.

We get the first two tweets, and print them.  That gives us the ID of
the oldest of those two.  We want tweets that are *younger* than that,
so our new maximum ID is *one less* than that.  We get those and move
on.

Warning 2: the number of tweets you ask for is the *upper bound* on the
number you get back.  You might get back that many, or you might get
fewer.  There are a variety of reasons for this that aren't worth
going into.  But, if you ask for 20, you can't assume there will be 20.

--------------------------------

What if we want to do this for the user *running* the program, rather
than UMBigData?  There's a *verb* for that!  Go back to the REST 1.1
API page, and click on:

     GET accounts/settings

So we can get the authenticated user (you), by doing this:

    settings = t.account.settings()
    user = settings['screen_name'];

That returns a user object, and that object includes the screen_name
of the authenticated user.  So, we will add that to our
get-four-tweets script, in

    currentUser.py

If you run this one, you should see *your* most recent four tweets,
rather than UMBigData's.

Note: for some reason, even though this is a GET, it is encoded as a
POST.  So, our Sample App framework has been given read/write access.
In other words, be careful, or you'll be posting a bunch of tweets as
yourself!

-------------------

You can even use this to get all of the tweets that a user has
ever tweeted.  The trick is you keep reading tweets until you can't get
any more.  The file

    allCurrentUser.py

shows how this works.  We start with the "newest" tweet-ID by that
user, and extract its nextID.

    newest = t.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=user,count=1)
    nextID = newest[0]['id']

When we start, we've printed none of the user's tweets:

    total = 0
    count = 0

Now, we want a loop to keep running until we run out of tweets.  We
don't know how long that will be, so we use "while True", which means
"loop forever."

(Don't worry, we won't really loop forever...)

We get the next (up to) 200 tweets, and print them.  The printTexts()
function returns *two* values---the oldest tweet seen so far, and the
number of tweets printed this round.  We update our nextID and the
total printed, sleep for a bit so we can see what is going on, and
continue. 

    while True :
	tweets = t.statuses.user_timeline(screen_name=user, 
					  count=200,
					  max_id = nextID)
	nextID, count = printTexts(tweets)
	if (nextID is None) :
	    break
	nextID = nextID - 1
	total = total + count
	time.sleep(2)
    

We print the total at the end.  Note that we might not get every
single tweet---again, that's because some might be missing "in the
middle".  But we will get almost all of them!

-------------------

There is also a search API.  Note that search doesn't mean "search all
tweets"---only a subset are indexed, and sometimes a surprisingly
small subset.  But, it does give you the opportunity to do some
exploration.

A simple set of examples can be found in search.py

The query language is very flexible.  For example, compare the current
mentions of the Detroit Tigers (who lost on a walk-off *balk* late
last night in Cleveland):

    result = t.search.tweets(q="Detroit Tigers")

To those before May 15th (when they were on a hot streak):

    result = t.search.tweets(q="Detroit Tigers until:2014-05-15")

You can also see some of my mentions of Tweet

    result = t.search.tweets(q="from:bdnoble tweet")


--------------------------

You can also search based on location---this is useful if you want to
compare reactions to the same event across different areas of the
country.  For example, last night the LA Kings played the Chicago
Blackhawks in the NHL playoffs.  So, you might want to see what each
is saying about "hockey".

First, you need a way to identify each place.  The file places.py
gives some examples of looking things up.  For LA and Chicago, we just
need the "Place ID".  For Ann Arbor, we'll want the "bounding
box"---the square that encompasses all of the city.  We can look up
any one of them this way:

    annarbor = t.geo.search(query="Ann Arbor", granularity="city")

Here are the location ids we need:

3b77caf94bfc81fe    Los Angeles, CA
1d9a5370a355ab0c      Chicago, IL

Once we have those locations, we can get hockey mentions for both
cities:

    result = t.search.tweets(q="hockey place:3b77caf94bfc81fe")
    result = t.search.tweets(q="hockey place:1d9a5370a355ab0c")

(Note that this can be *from* that place, or *about* that place.)

----------------------------------------------------

There is another API that isn't a request/response mechanism.
Instead, you get to "sample" the live twitter stream as it happens.
This isn't the full stream---that's called the Firehose, and mere
mortals don't get it---but this is a good sample of the total.

The Stream interface is different from the REST API, so you have to
create a different "master object" for it.  We authenticate as normal,
but then use the authentication tokens to also create a stream:

    t = oauthDance.login()

    # Streaming is a different interface
    ts = twitter.TwitterStream(auth=t.auth)

You then create a "filter" that includes what you are interested in,
and you get tweets that match that filter.  For example, if you were
interested in Lions, Tigers, and Bears, you could do this:

    # Oh My!
    iterator = ts.statuses.filter(track="Lions,Tigers,Bears")

    for tweet in iterator :
	print tweet['text']


This filter is implemented in the file stream.py.  It keeps running
until you stop it.


You can also limit your filters based on location.  For example,
stream2.py uses the Ann Arbor location bounding box to get tweets
from/about Ann Arbor.  (Note that this doesn't always work perfectly,
but it usually comes close.)

    # Ann Arbor Bounding Box from places lookup
    # [-83.799572, 42.222668], [-83.675807, 42.222668], 
    # [-83.675807, 42.323973], [-83.799572, 42.323973]
    #
    # For location, we use Longitude then Latitutde.
    # Southern/western corner first
    # Northern/eastern corner second

    iterator = ts.statuses.filter(locations="-83.8,42.223,-83.676,42.324")


It's a little disturbing to watch what gets tweeted in A2,
particularly late at night....
